# HTML Advanced Project – CSS Advanced

This repository contains my implementation of the **HTML Advanced Project** and **CSS Advance Project**, which focuses on creating a semantic, accessible, and well-structured website. The styling for this project is guided by a Figma design file.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The main goals of this project are:
- To practice advanced **HTML5 semantic structure** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- To implement **flexible layouts** using CSS Flexbox.
- To replicate the provided **Figma design** into a working webpage.
- To ensure **responsiveness**, including mobile-friendly behavior.

This project is a continuation of the **HTML basics project**, but with additional emphasis on **style, layout, and design fidelity**.
